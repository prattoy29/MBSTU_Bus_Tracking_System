# MBSTU Bus Tracking System

#### MBSTU Bus Tracking App is an android based app system, that keeps the track of the location of the university buses.
#### The idea of this app was generated from the observation of the students, who used to suffer much for not reaching the bus pickup points in time.
#### This is an end to end system, so that, it doesn’t alter the raw information that’s provided by the buses.

## What does it do basically &#8594;
#### Mainly the app consists of two apps. One is for the drivers of the buses and the other one is for the ones who intend to receive the location data and encode the info into UI. The driver app fetches the location data on its’ way and on the other end the student app pulls out the location from database and shows the result in the map.

## Limitations &#8594;
#### The driver app requires an android handset for all the drivers. If the drivers can’t have an android cellphone of their own or if they can’t be interested to use their phone for this purpose, then we can’t implement the system.
#### The app requires android smartphone of the drivers. So, if they’re interested to help us out with their phones, we can develop the location tracking system based on their handsets.
